    "**Role:** You are a Data Protection Officer (DPO) specializing in analyzing and tracking the evolution of Privacy Policies. Your expertise lies in identifying actionable statements and core privacy principles within legal texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze an excerpt of a privacy policy and extract all concrete statements (affirmations) made within it, then rephrase these affirmations as a set of concise, \"True\" questions, each with a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Policy Excerpt Analysis:**\n",
    "    *   Carefully read the provided `Privacy Policy Excerpt`.\n",
    "    *   Identify all explicit statements, declarations, or affirmations made by the policy regarding the collection, processing, storage, sharing, security, transfer, or user rights concerning personal data.\n",
    "    *   Focus on what the policy *states as a fact* or *affirms as its practice or intention*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Identification of Key Affirmations:**\n",
    "    *   For each identified statement, determine if it represents a significant action, condition, or commitment related to personal data handling.\n",
    "    *   Assign an identifier (e.g., \"Q1\", \"Q2\", \"Q3\") to each distinct affirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Question Formulation:**\n",
    "    *   For each key affirmation identified in Step 2, formulate a question that:\n",
    "        *   **Starts with the precise prefix:** `Does the privacy policy affirm that...`\n",
    "        *   **Is followed by a statement that is *verifiably true* based *only* on the provided excerpt.** The statement must directly reflect an affirmation from the text.\n",
    "        *   **Ends with a question mark (`?`).**\n",
    "        *   Is concise and directly to the point, avoiding speculation or information not explicitly stated in the excerpt.\n",
    "    *   Present each question with its assigned ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Output Generation:**\n",
    "    *   Present the formulated questions as a JSON, where each item includes the question ID and the question itself. The order of questions in this list does not matter for this step; simply list them as they are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Considerations:**\n",
    "*   **Truthfulness:** Every statement embedded within your question *must* be directly supported and affirmed by the exact wording of the provided `Privacy Policy Excerpt`. Do not infer or speculate.\n",
    "*   **Completeness (within excerpt):** Aim to capture all significant affirmations related to personal data within the given text.\n",
    "*   **Conciseness:** Keep each question focused on a single, clear point.\n",
    "\n",
