In those cases, the commercial customer is the controller, and you can review their policies for more information about how they handle your personal data.\\n\\nPlease see our [Non-User Privacy Policy](https://anthropic.com/legal/non-user-privacy-policy) for information on how our large language models are ‘trained’ and how personal data obtained from third party sources, including where others may submit personal data when using our services, may be used when developing or delivering our products and services.\\n\\nThis Privacy Policy also describes your privacy rights. More information about your rights, and how to exercise them, is set out in Section 4 (“Rights and Choices”).\\n\\nIf you are located in Canada, please read section 11 of the Privacy Policy which applies to you.\\n\\nIf you are located in Brazil, please read section 12 of the Privacy Policy which applies to you.\\n\\n## 1.

We may also collect or generate indirect identifiers (e.g., “USER12345”).\\n* **Payment Information:**\\xa0We shall collect your payment information if you choose to purchase access to Anthropic’s products and services.\\n* **Inputs and Outputs:**\\xa0You are able to interact with our Services in a variety of formats, including but not limited to chat, coding, and agentic sessions (**“Prompts”**\\xa0or\\xa0**\"Inputs\"**), which generate responses and actions (**“Outputs”**) based on your Inputs. This includes third-party applications you choose to integrate with our Services. If you include personal data or reference external content in your Inputs, we will collect that information and this information may be reproduced in your Outputs.\\n* **Feedback on your use of our Services:**\\xa0We appreciate feedback, including ideas and suggestions for improvement or rating an Output in response to an Input (\"**Feedback**\"). If you rate an Output in response to an Input—for example, by using the thumbs up/thumbs down icon—we will store the entire related conversation as part of your Feedback. You can learn more about how we use Feedback [here](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023565-how-does-anthropic-use-submitted-feedback).\\n* **Communication Information:**\\xa0If you communicate with us, including via our chatbot on our Help site, we collect your name, contact information, and the contents of any messages you send.\\n\\n### Personal data we receive automatically from your use of the Services\\n\\nWhen you use the Services, we also receive certain technical data automatically (described below, collectively “**Technical Information**”).

This information includes log files. If you or your device experiences an error, we may collect information about the error, the time the error occurred, the feature being used, the state of the application when the error occurred, and any communications or content provided at the time the error occurred.\\n* **Cookies & Similar Technologies.**We and our service providers use cookies, scripts, or similar technologies (“**Cookies**”) to manage the Services and to collect information about you and your use of the Services. These technologies help us to recognize you, customize or personalize your experience, market additional products or services to you, and analyze the use of our Services to make them safer and more useful to you.

Even if you opt-out, we will use Inputs and Outputs for model improvement when: (1) your conversations are flagged for safety review to improve our ability to detect harmful content, enforce our policies, or advance AI safety research, or (2) you\\'ve explicitly reported the materials to us (for example via our feedback mechanisms).\\n\\nPlease see Section 10 below for details of our legal bases for processing your personal data.\\n\\n## 3. How We Disclose Personal Data\\n\\nAnthropic will disclose personal data to the following categories of third parties for the purposes explained in this Policy:\\n\\n* **Affiliates & corporate partners.**\\xa0Anthropic discloses the categories of personal data described above between and among its affiliates and related entities.\\n* **Service providers & business partners.**\\xa0Anthropic may disclose the categories of personal data described above with service providers and business partners for a variety of business purposes, including website and data hosting, ensuring compliance with industry standards, research, auditing, data processing, and providing you with the services.\\n\\nAnthropic may also disclose personal data in the following circumstances:\\n\\n* **As part of a significant corporate event.**\\xa0If Anthropic is involved in a merger, corporate transaction, bankruptcy, or other situation involving the transfer of business assets, Anthropic will disclose your personal data as part of these corporate transactions.\\n* **Third-Party Websites and Services:**Our Services may involve integrations with, or may direct you to, websites, apps, and services managed by third parties. By interacting with these third parties, you are providing information directly to the third party and not Anthropic and subject to the third party’s privacy policy.If you access third-party services, such as social media sites or other sites linked through the Services (e.g., if you follow a link to our Twitter account), these third-party services will be able to collect personal data about you, including information about your activity on the Services. If we link to a site or service via our Services, you should read their data usage policies or other documentation. Our linking to another site or service doesn’t mean we endorse it or speak for that third party.\\n* **Pursuant to regulatory or legal requirements, safety, rights of others, and to enforce our rights or our terms.**\\xa0We may disclose personal data to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for legal, tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal data to third parties in connection with claims, disputes or litigation, when otherwise permitted or required by law, or if we determine its disclosure is necessary to protect the health and safety of you or any other person, to protect against fraud or credit risk, to enforce our legal rights or the legal rights of others, to enforce contractual commitments that you have made, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.\\n* **With an individual\\'s consent.**\\xa0Anthropic will otherwise disclose personal data when an individual gives us permission or directs us to disclose this information, including as a part of our Services.\\n\\nYou can find information on our\\xa0[Subprocessor List](https://www.anthropic.com/subprocessors)\\xa0about the third parties Anthropic engages to help us process personal data provided to us where Anthropic acts as a data processor, such as with respect to personal data we receive, process, store, or host when you use Anthropic\\'s commercial services.\\n\\n## 4. Rights and Choices\\n\\nDepending on where you live and the laws that apply in your country of residence, you may enjoy certain rights regarding your personal data, as described further below. However, please be aware that these rights are limited, and that the process by which we may need to action your requests regarding our training dataset are complex. We may also decline a request if we have a lawful reason for doing so. That said, we strive to prioritize the protection of personal data, and comply with all applicable privacy laws.\\n\\nTo exercise your rights, you or an authorized agent may submit a request by emailing us at\\xa0[privacy@anthropic.com](mailto:privacy@anthropic.com). After we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. You may also have the right to appeal requests that we deny by emailing\\xa0[privacy@anthropic.com](mailto:privacy@anthropic.com). Anthropic will not discriminate based on the exercising of privacy rights you may have. Set out below is a summary of the rights which you may enjoy, depending on the laws that apply in your country of residence.\\n\\n* **Right to know:**\\xa0the right to know what personal data Anthropic processes about you, including the categories of personal data, the categories of sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purposes for collection, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it.\\n* **Access & data portability:** the right to request a copy of the personal data Anthropic processes about you, subject to certain exceptions and conditions. In certain cases and subject to applicable law, you have the right to port your information.\\n* **Deletion:**the right to request that we delete personal data collected from you when you use our Services, subject to certain exceptions. You also are able to\\xa0[delete individual conversations](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8230524-how-can-i-delete-or-rename-a-conversation), which will be removed immediately from your conversation history and automatically deleted from our back-end within 30 days. Learn more\\xa0[here](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023548-how-long-do-you-store-personal-data).\\n* **Correction:**the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal data Anthropic retains about you, subject to certain exceptions. Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Outputs. If Outputs contain factually inaccurate personal data relating to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make a reasonable effort to correct this information—but due to the technical complexity of our large language models, it may not always be possible for us to do so.\\n* **Objection:** the right to object to processing of your personal data, including profiling conducted on grounds of public or legitimate interest. In places where such a right applies, we will no longer process the personal data in case of such objection unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. If we use your information for direct marketing, you can object and opt out of future direct marketing messages using the unsubscribe link in such communications.\\n* **Restriction:** the right to restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.\\n* **Withdrawal of consent.**\\xa0Where Anthropic’s processing of your personal data is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.\\n* **Automated decision-making**: Anthropic does not engage in decision making based solely on automated processing or profiling in a manner which produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services).\\n* **Sale & targeted Anthropic marketing of its products and services**. Anthropic does not “sell” your personal data as that term is defined by applicable laws and regulations. You can opt-out of sharing your personal data for targeted advertising to promote our products and services, and we will honor global privacy controls. To learn more,\\xa0[click here](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/cookies).\\n\\nAnthropic gives you access to a variety of tools to help you manage your data. You can access these in your [Privacy Settings](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.7bce1733-92a4-4087-91be-15690999445c/settings/privacy).\\n\\n## 5. Data Transfers\\n\\nWhen you access our website or Services, your personal data may be transferred to our servers in the US, or to other countries outside the European Economic Area (**“EEA”**) and the UK. This may be a direct provision of your personal data to us, or a transfer that we or a third party make.\\n\\nWhere information is transferred outside the EEA or the UK, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:\\n\\n* **Adequacy decisions.**These are decisions from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country outside of the EEA offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “Collection of Personal Data” to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed\\xa0[here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en); or\\n* **Standard contractual clauses.**The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “Collection of Personal Data” to certain affiliates and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.\\n\\nIn certain situations, we rely on derogations provided for under applicable data protection law to transfer information to a third country.\\n\\n## 6. Data Retention, Data Lifecycle, and Security Controls\\n\\nAnthropic retains your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes and criteria outlined in this Privacy Policy and explained further in our\\xa0[privacy center](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023548-how-long-do-you-store-personal-data).\\n\\nWhen the personal data collected is no longer required by us, we and our service providers will perform the necessary procedures for destroying, deleting, erasing, or converting it into an anonymous form as permitted or required under applicable laws.\\n\\n### Aggregated or De-Identified Information\\n\\nWe may process personal data in an aggregated or de-identified form to analyze the effectiveness of our Services, conduct research, study user behavior, and train our AI models as permitted under applicable laws. For instance:\\n\\n* When you submit Feedback, we disassociate Inputs and Outputs from your user ID to use them for training and improving our models.\\n* If our systems flag Inputs or Outputs for potentially violating our\\xa0[Usage Policy](https://anthropic.com/legal/aup), we disassociate the content from your user ID to train our trust and safety internal classification and generative models. However, we may re-identify the Inputs or Outputs to enforce our Usage Policy with the responsible user if necessary.\\n* To improve user experience, we may analyze and aggregate general user behavior and usage data. This information does not identify individual users.\\n\\n### Security Controls Relating to our Processing of Personal Data\\n\\nWe implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.\\n\\n## 7. Children\\n\\nOur Services are not directed towards, and we do not knowingly collect, use, disclose, sell, or share any information from children under the age of 18. If you become aware that a child under the age of 18 has provided any personal data to us while using our Services, please email us at\\xa0[privacy@anthropic.com](mailto:privacy@anthropic.com)\\xa0and we will investigate the matter and, if appropriate, delete the personal data.\\n\\n## 8. Changes to Our Privacy Policy\\n\\nAnthropic may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy, as appropriate, and update the Effective Date at the top of\\xa0<https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy>. You can view a summary of privacy policy changes and previous versions in our [Privacy Center](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10301952-updates-to-our-privacy-policy).\\n\\n## 9. Contact Information\\n\\nIf you live in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK or Switzerland (the “European Region”), the data controller responsible for your personal data is Anthropic Ireland, Limited. If you live outside the European Region, the data controller responsible for your personal data is Anthropic PBC.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or have any questions, complaints or requests regarding your personal data, you can contact us as described below:\\n\\n* Anthropic PBC with a registered address at 548 Market St, PMB 90375, San Francisco, CA 94104 (United States).\\n* Anthropic Ireland, Limited with a registered address at 6th Floor, South Bank House, Barrow Street.
