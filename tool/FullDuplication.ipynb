    "## 0.3 Assumptions and Constraints about the data:\n",
    "### 0.3.1 Embedding vector assumptions:\n",
    "#### 0.3.1.1 Underlying data:\n",
    "Since our embedding vectors sets all represent **different** views on the same fundamental data, we can treat this as $E_i(x) + \\varepsilon_i$. Where $x$ represents the latent semantic concept/intent of the privacy obligation, and the embedding vector is a noisy observation of that concept.\n",
    "#### 0.3.1.2 Embedding Space Correlation:\n",
    "Naively we may not expect correlation between different embedding spaces, but this is an incorrect assumption. At a minimum, the distances are correlated. We expect any good `embedding_model` to cluster `apples` near `pears`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The justification for why we can also infer information across the actual vectors, is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given embedding sets produced by `gemini-embeddings-001`, using different `task_type`s, and different string manipulation functions **(See Appendix 0.3.1.2)**, we can expect correlation in both noise and distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "However they are not exact, I exploit these differences to tune different tasks, like document retrieval and filtering. Since different `task type`'s do not significantly change performance, i.e we can both use \"FACT_VERIFICATION\" and \"RETRIEVAL_QUERY\" for document retrieval via max cosine similarity to high accuracy, however the core similarity is highly correlated. As such we can expect some relationships between:\n",
    "- The actual vectors.\n",
    "- The distances.\n",
    "- The distributions of these, the extreme values, and other statistical measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further for different embedding types, we can always just compute the correlation of vectors between them and either, filter and only apply our inference across correlated sets. Or adjust our prior not to consider inferences when this is just noise, which is mathematically trivial. \n",
    "#### 0.3.1.3 Nearest Neighbour (`NN`) assumptions:\n",
    "Some metrics involve computing the nearest neighbour to given vectors, this assumption works well with some metrics and computations. For example, clustering assumes this since we expect our clustering at distance threshold $\\tau$ to be more accurate than $\\tau + \\delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However this assumption in general is quite fragile. Especially if we have a systematic bias, i.e they are not `NN`'s in any embedding space. It may be possible to rectify if we know or can estimate $P(\\textrm{equivalent\\_question} | \\textrm{NN})$ or $P(\\textrm{equivalent\\_question} | \\neg\\textrm{NN})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally for some metrics the `NN` assumption is acceptable, I haven't seen any difference when omitting non-`NN` pairs from the **Jaccard Index**, and only around a 10% drop in **total** clusters using **ACCC** and even  less divergences in the correlated clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3.2 Lexical Data Assumptions \n",
    "#### 0.3.2.1 Truthfulness of Substring Identification\n",
    "The particular `supporting substring`s corresponding to identified are highly likely however they may not be all true. For the sake of simplicity at this point we will assume they are correct, but it is worth noting this assumption.\n",
    "#### 0.3.2.2 Completeness of Substring Identification\n",
    "Unlike the truthfulness, completeness (that we have all the relevant substring indices, for all questions) is trivially not highly likely. If it was complete, we would have a significantly easier time computing `equivalent_question`s by cross validation. However the completeness a priori is undefined, we expect our model to hold regardless of the completeness of this. Since the use case will be merging questions and perhaps we may compute multiple runs, therefore completeness is necessarily variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3.3 Probabilistic Constraints:\n",
    "#### 0.3.3.1 Origin Statistics:\n",
    "Since the origin is from a sample of similar documents `Privacy Policies` and similar contexts (different providers of similar services), we expect the strings to have some correlation and be non i.i.d.\n",
    "#### 0.3.3.2 Zero-Shot / Unsupervised:\n",
    "We have no labeled **true** `equivalent_question`.\n",
    "#### 0.3.3.3 Exogenous Heuristics:\n",
    "We cannot rely on metrics like \"top 1% nearest neighbors.\" since we have no a priori knowledge about the tails or extreme values, thus all probabilities must be inferred from the data alone, i.e properties of the vector space and the consensus between embedding views, lexical data, origin validation.\n",
    "#### 0.3.3.4 Multivariate Dependencies\n",
    "All our metrics are likely to be improved by conditioning on a variety of factors and statistics. Hence we are currently looking for a granular breakdown of each factor, such that we can **later** deduce these relationships for our model.\n",
    "#### 0.3.3.5 Distribution Shape\n",
    "Since we have no a priori knowledge about the shape of distributions, we cannot rely on predetermined distribution shapes or characteristics for our models. Assume distributions are non-standard, heavy-tailed, and non-i.i.d. (So even standard tools like Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem may be invalid)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Core Task:\n",
    "I have been experimenting and prototyping without any real structure, I have pinpointed various pitfalls I have made in my previous models.\n",

    "\tIn some models I use different metrics and considerations leading to variations in applicability and accuracy.\n",
    "2. Understanding of the inference tools and mathematics:\n",
    "\tSince I have been rapidly prototyping and experimenting, some of my models end up having pretty arbitrary meausures and calculations. This often is influenced by poorly defining the above issues, as well as having a defined process, and either thinking about the model and parts too granularly or too broadly **(See Appendix 1.2)**.\n",
    "3. Identifying my assumptions:\n",
    "\tIn some models, I end up comparing distributions that come from subtly different assumptions leading to inaccuracies and incorrect inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat these, I want to start from scratch. Rigorously laying out the different, assumptions and statistics we can use to help me produce a defined process. We are not looking to build the model, just fill out our set of data we can utilise, metrics and functions we can compute by manipulating this data. And our underlying assumptions about the behaviour of the data.\n",

    "## 0.0 Distance Metrics\n",
    "We can use Mahalanobis, Cosine, l1, l2 distances in general. Currently the best performing is `Mahalanobis` infact we can significantly truncate our vectors and achieve performance on par with Cosine. In particular, the MTEB score of the full `gemini-embeddings-001` our primary embedding model, at the full 3072 dimensions is 68.17, 66.19 at 256, and 63.31 at 128.  Truncation is a good capability since we can make meaningful inferences from the `Mahalanobis` vectors from a small sample.\n",
    "## 0.2 Data we can compute\n",
    "### 0.2.1.2 Embedding type comparisons:\n",
    "#### 0.2.1.2.1 Jaccard Index:\n",
    "This optimises for the Maximized Pairwise Jaccard Similarity (intersection over union of pair) we iterate over distance thresholds for both embedding views to find the configuration that maximizes the overlap of identified pairs, over the smallest threshold $\\tau$. We can additionally compute the maximum radius that retain congruent `**Jaccard** Clusters` that were found above. (Independent of other unrelated cluster mutation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 0.2.1.2.2 Average Consensus-Supporting Cluster Count (ACCC) Metric:\n",
    "In a similar iteration process to **(Appendix 0: 0.2.1.2.1)**, but our scoring metric the maximum count of clusters per model that are validated by the intersection of all pair sets. This metric rewards cluster granularity supported by consensus. It calculates the number of distinct clusters (in both views) that contain at least one pair found in the intersection.From this the identified consensus clusters, all clusters at the optimal, and the particular embedding type-wise thresholds may be interesting at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2.3.1 Substrings:\n",
    "The relevant indices correspond to the placement in the entire source document, thus a sufficient identification criterion is document_hash && substring_indices.\n",
    "### 0.2.4 Lexical Computations:\n",
    "Lexical analysis may become necessary to have a useful model, previous failings often fail with small scale substitutions. This is critical since  we may have very similar words that imply a distinct legal obligation, e.g:\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Does the privacy policy affirm that the Services are not directed to children under 13?\n",
    " - Does the privacy policy affirm that the Services are not intended for children under 13?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Represent distinct legal obligations for GDPR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore some ideas like both accounting for the likelihood of individual words, phrases, distance of actual string tokens. Perhaps we could also infer useful information from a tokeniser like `SentencePiece`. We can also locally train some model to better reflect our data origin and/or question corpus.\n",
    "## 0.3 Embedding vector assumptions\n",
    "#### 0.3.1.2 Embedding Space Correlation:\n",
    "From empirical tests, we can improve performance of some tasks by manipulating the strings, here are two example manipulations that we could have:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def example_question_manipulation_1(question):\n",
    "\tprefix = \"Does the privacy policy affirm\"\n",
    "\treplacement = \"The privacy policy affirms\"\n",
    "\tprocessed_text = (\"The privacy policy affirms\" + question[len(prefix) :])[:-1] + \".\"\n",

    "\tprocessed_text = (question[len(prefix) :].capitalize())[:-1] + \".\"\n",
    "\treturn processed_text\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example usage of `Function:example_question_manipulation_1` produces the most accurate results for deriving string matches in a document embedded with `task_type` `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` via the cosine similarity. However, different `task_type`'s also produce good results, i.e using the original question string embedded with `RETRIEVAL_QUERY` and the same document embedding vector is only marginally worse. This validates our cross embedding-type statistical analysis.\n",

    "Some factors I have failed to previously consider include:\n",
    "**Legal Terminology:** We may have very similar words that imply a distinct legal obligation:\n",

    " - Does the privacy policy affirm that the Services are not directed to children under 13?\n",

    "```\n",
    "Represent distinct legal obligations for GDPR.\n",
    "### 1.2 Understanding of the inference tools and mathematics:\n",
    "In some previous, non-inferential models, I wanted to determine the expected number of true equivalents out of all clusters.\n",
    "I ended up relying on the count of `**Jaccard** Clusters` over some representation for expected number of total clusters. I ended up using different methods for my representation of total clusters:\n",
    "- The amount of clusters at the maximal radius that retain coherent `**Jaccard** Clusters` (no modifications to these identified clusters)\n",
    "- The total amount of clusters at the optimal **ACCC** thresholds.\n",
    "Then I averaged this over all embedding types, my internal justification was that the `**Jaccard** Clusters` represented the clusters at some elbow of the cluster topology. However, there is no reason that this ratio is fixed at different distance thresholds $\\tau$. And this is even worse since the threshold at **ACCC** is distinctly different to the thresholds used to compute the min and max $\\tau$ for the optimal Jaccard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that this seemed to work is probably coincidental, this is supported by the observation: Incorporate these metrics as some baseline in an inferential **EM Model** to speed up convergence and it seemed incredibly fragile to different distance metrics. In fact, the ratio is distinctly different, it would make sense for this to be more or less invariant for different different metrics. \n",
